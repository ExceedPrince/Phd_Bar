# Phd Bar Client Side

There are some secret/dynamic information in this code, which can be found in .env files in both sides of the project.
Of course, they are not in this repository because of the gitignore (and in dockerignore, too), so if you would like to run the code, you should use your own API keys and of course your own MongoDB database.

Details about environment variables:
- Frontend:
	REACT_APP_BE_URL= The URL of the server side where it runs with the number of the PORT on its end

For running the client side you should open the 'frontend' folder and type in the 'npm install' command and then: npm start

Thank you reading me and and have fun!
